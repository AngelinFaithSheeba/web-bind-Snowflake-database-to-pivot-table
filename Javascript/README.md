A quick start project for connecting a Snowflake database to a Syncfusion Pivot Table. This repository includes a Web API Controller ([MyWebService](../MyWebService/)) for retrieving data from a Snowflake database, as well as a quick start sample in the JavaScript platform that displays the retrieved data in a Syncfusion Pivot Table.
